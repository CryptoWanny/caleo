      <p>
        Caleo is a calorie tracking application that uses Aleo blockchain
        technology. It is designed for use by trainers to mint daily caloric
        allowances for their trainees based on their performance and physical
        condition.
      </p>
      <h2>The Mint Function</h2>
      <p>
        The core functionality of the Caleo application is provided by the
        `mint` function. This function takes several input parameters and uses
        them to calculate the daily caloric allowance for a specified
        individual.
      </p>
      <h3>Input Parameters</h3>
      <p>The `mint` function takes the following input parameters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          `owner`: The address of the individual for whom the daily caloric
          allowance is being calculated.
        </li>
        <li>`weight`: The weight of the individual in kilograms.</li>
        <li>
          `gender`: The gender of the individual, represented as a binary value
          where 0 represents male and 1 represents female.
        </li>
        <li>`age`: The age of the individual in years.</li>
        <li>`height`: The height of the individual in centimeters.</li>
        <li>
          `activity_level`: The activity level of the individual, represented as
          an integer value where 0 represents sedentary, 1 represents lightly
          active, 2 represents moderately active, and 3 represents very active.
        </li>
        <li>
          `dietary_preference`: The dietary preference of the individual,
          represented as an integer value where 0 represents low-carb, 1
          represents balanced, and 2 represents high-carb.
        </li>
        <li>
          `health_goal`: The health goal of the individual, represented as an
          integer value where 0 represents weight loss, 1 represents
          maintenance, and 2 represents weight gain.
        </li>
        <li>
          `calories_yesterday`: The number of calories consumed by the
          individual yesterday.
        </li>
        <li>
          `todays_training`: The number of calories burned by the individual
          during today's training.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Variables</h3>
      <p>
        The `mint` function uses several internal variables to perform its
        calculations. These variables include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          `bmr`: The basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the individual, calculated
          using their weight, gender, age, and height.
        </li>
        <li>
          `adjusted_bmr`: The BMR adjusted based on the individual's activity
          level.
        </li>
        <li>
          `daily_calories`: The daily caloric needs of the individual, adjusted
          based on their dietary preference.
        </li>
        <li>
          `goal_calories`: The daily caloric needs of the individual, adjusted
          based on their health goal.
        </li>
        <li>
          `allowance`: The final daily caloric allowance for the individual,
          calculated by subtracting the calories consumed yesterday from the
          goal calories and adding today's training.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Outputs</h3>

      <p>The `mint` function returns a tuple containing five values:</p>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          A new `Calorie` record with the calculated daily caloric allowance for
          the specified individual.
        </li>
        <li>The calculated BMR of the individual.</li>
        <li>The adjusted BMR of the individual.</li>
        <li>The daily caloric needs of the individual.</li>
        <li>The final daily caloric allowance for the individual.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Harris-Benedict Equation and Metabolic Rate</h2>

      <p>
        The Harris-Benedict equation is a formula that calculates an
        individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR) by taking into account their
        weight, height, age, and gender. The BMR represents the number of
        calories that an individual's body needs to perform basic functions at
        rest, such as breathing, circulating blood, and maintaining hormone
        levels. Knowing your BMR is important because it helps you determine how
        many calories you may want to consume based on your goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Metabolic rate refers to the rate at which an individual's body converts
        food into energy. It is important because it provides the body with the
        energy it needs to perform essential functions such as breathing and
        digestion. An individual's body needs a minimum number of calories to
        sustain these functions. Factors such as age, sex, muscle mass, and
        physical activity can affect an individual's metabolic rate or BMR.
      </p>

      <h2>Input File</h2>

      <p>
        In addition to defining the `mint` function in the `main.leo` file,
        Caleo also includes an input file named `caleo.in`. This file specifies
        values for each of the input parameters of the `mint` function. These
        values are used when running the program to calculate the daily caloric
        allowance for a specified individual. Here is an example of an input
        file:
      </p>

      <pre>
// The program input for simple_token/src/main.leo
[mint]
owner: address = aleo1ht2a9q0gsd38j0se4t9lsfulxgqrens2vgzgry3pkvs93xrrzu8s892zn7;
weight: u64 = 75u64;
gender: u64 = 1u64;
age: u64 = 30u64;
height: u64 = 180u64;
activity_level: u64 = 1u64;
dietary_preference: u64 = 1u64;
health_goal: u64 = 1u64;
calories_yesterday: u64 = 2000u64;
todays_training: u64 = 500u64;
</pre
      >

      <p>
        In this example, values are specified for each of the input parameters
        of the `mint` function. When running Caleo with this input file, it will
        calculate a daily caloric allowance for an individual with a weight of
        75 kilograms, a gender of female (represented by a value of 1), an age
        of 30 years, a height of 180 centimeters, an activity level of lightly
        active (represented by a value of 1), a dietary preference of balanced
        (represented by a value of 1), a health goal of maintenance (represented
        by a value of 1), who consumed 2000 calories yesterday and burned 500
        calories during today's training.
      </p>
